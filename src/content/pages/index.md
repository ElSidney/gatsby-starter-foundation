He is a award winning gaming graphic designer, based in sunny side of California. Working as Principal designer at Bethesda but we need to klnow how much text we can get on the home page.

this is a thing t hat we do not know right now but we really do need to know it.

ok so it seems that it will display the text on the front page, the home page if you will, or even if you wont. so that is good to know.

but how much? How much!?! that is the next thing that we need to know.

And know it we will.
